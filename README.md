## task 2

Develop a game of Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe on a 10 x 10 board with the Five in a Row rule - whoever loses
who got a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row of five of their figures (tic-tac-toe).
The game should work in the "human versus computer" mode.

The game can be console

When developing a game, take into account the principle of DRY (don’t repeat yourself) - “do not repeat yourself”.
That is, to minimize code repetition and increase its reusability through the use of functions.
Functions should have their own area of responsibility.

```
run code: python3 tic-tac-toe.py
```

## task 3

Using OOP to design and implement a geometric calculator

for calculations performed on figures. The calculator must support calculations for flat and three-dimensional figures.

Flat figures: circle, square, rectangle, triangle, trapezium, rhombus.
Volumetric figures: sphere, cube, parallelepiped, pyramid, cylinder, cone.

Implement at least one general calculation method for all shapes and at least one specific to certain shapes. For example, area is a general method for all figures, median is a specific method for a number of figures.

It is necessary: ​​to implement a graphical interface for the possibility of user interaction with the program and visualization of figures (taking into account the entered figure parameters).

When implementing, use all kinds of methods: static, class and instance method. 

```
run code: python3 main.py
```
